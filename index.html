title: My Github YAML Editor Micro Tool Base

<h1>API Stylebook (Builder)</h1>
<p>I was pretty stoked when my friend Arnaud Lauret developed the <a href="http://apistylebook.com/">API Stylebook</a>. I took the <a href="https://github.com/arno-di-loreto/apistylebook-api/blob/master/design/topics.yaml" target="_blank">YAML core of the design topics</a> he's aggregated, and started developing this editor that runs 100% on Github, so that anyone to fork, and use to build their own API Stylebook using Arnaud's work.</p>
<p>Currently there are two screens for this tool:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="edit/">Editor</a> - Allows for the editing of the YAML API Design Stylebook stored in this Github repository.</li>
  <li><a href="view/">View</a> - Allow syou to view the API Design Stylbook stored in this Github repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a prototype. You are welcome to fork, but I will keep working on it, adding autocomplete suggestions based upon other API design guides, and the ability to ignore some elements. Maybe I'll also work on allowing the addition of elements to the design guide--both categories and elements.</p>
<p>I will add these to the <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-tools/api-design-guide/issues" target="_blank">Github issues for the project</a>. If you have any feedback, or suggestions let me know.</p>
